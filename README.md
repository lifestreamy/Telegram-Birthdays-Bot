# Telegram_Birthdays_Bot
I am creating a custom telegram bot with such description:
"This bot
1)Can store your friends' id's, names, dates of birth and wishlists. 
You can create "a friend" locally or add someone to friends to retrieve info about them. 
2)Can remind you about your friends' birthdays.
3)Lets you cross out which gift from a friend's wishlist you are willing to buy (everyone related will see the updated list)
/start"
